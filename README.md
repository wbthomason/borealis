The universal package manager (really, a package manager manager).
Provides a clean, sane interface for managing packages, and wraps existing managers as sources/allows for the definition of custom sources so that you can manage installations the same way across all your machines and platforms.
Safe, fast, and highly customizable.
May listen to loud music. Will not destroy your cat.
